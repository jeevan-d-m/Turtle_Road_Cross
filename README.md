# Turtle Road Cross

## Overview

The Turtle Road Cross project is a Python-based game that leverages the Turtle graphics library to create an engaging experience.
In this game, the player controls a turtle character that must navigate a busy road filled with randomly moving obstacles. 
The objective is to guide the turtle safely across the road without colliding with any obstacles.

### Key Features:

- **Turtle Graphics:** Utilizes the Turtle module in Python to create a graphical user interface for the game.

- **Randomly Moving Obstacles:** Generates random obstacles that move across the screen, creating dynamic challenges for the player.

- **User Input:** Allows the player to control the turtle's movement using keyboard input.

- **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of the player's score based on successful road crossings.

- **Collision Detection:** Implements collision detection to determine if the turtle collides with any obstacles.

- **Levels of Difficulty:** Gradually increases the difficulty by introducing faster-moving obstacles or additional challenges as the player progresses.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (usually included in standard Python installations)

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jeevan-d-m/turtle-road-cross.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd turtle-road-cross
    ```

3. Run the game:

    ```bash
    python turtle_road_cross.py
    ```

4. Use the arrow keys to control the turtle's movement:
   - Up arrow: Move the turtle forward
   - Down arrow: Move the turtle backward
   - Left arrow: Move the turtle to the left
   - Right arrow: Move the turtle to the right

5. Avoid colliding with moving obstacles.

6. Enjoy the game and try to achieve the highest score possible!

## Customization

- Adjust the game settings, such as the speed of the obstacles or the appearance of the turtle, by modifying variables in the code.
